<p>The Reason the birch tree is white is because it reflects most of the suns rays.<br/>
  Dark trees absorb light while white trees reflect it.</p>

  <p>The Paper birch can naturally live to at least 140 years,<br/>
    But if tree is cultivated it can only live for 30 to 40 years long.<br/> 
    (cultivated means has not been grown naturally it has been planted my man)</p>

<p>The birch tree is a very beautiful tree but its roots grow close the the surface.<br/>
  This means that it can damage footpaths and ruin the look of your land. It can also<br/>
  be unsafe the roots can grow too high and you could trip over, also it is not a good idea<br/>
  to grow paper birch close to your house as its roots can damage your house.</p>
