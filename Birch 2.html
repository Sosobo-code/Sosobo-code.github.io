<p>Paper brich naturally require at least 2-3 hours of watering to survive this is about 8-18 inches of water.<br/>
    Cultivated birch is the same 2-3 hours of watering the roots (not at one time) and 8-18 inches of water</p>

<p>The birch tree is a very beautiful tree but its roots grow close the the surface.<br/>
  This means that it can damage footpaths and ruin the look of your land. It can also<br/>
  be unsafe the roots can grow too high and you could trip over, also it is not a good idea<br/>
  to grow paper birch close to your house as its roots can damage your house.</p>

<h3>The environment of birch and its adaptations</h3>
<marquee scrollamount="5">This is a very important part of plants that i nearly forgot!</marquee>
<div class="center">
  <p>Birch is a tree that normally grows around lakes and streams.  It grows in the tundras<br/>
  and surprisingly easily grows in areas destroyed by wildfires. Birch trees will mostly grow in Europe<br/>
  and even more in Northern Europe.</p>
  </div>
  <marquee scrollamount="6">How has birch adapted to it environment in the tundra</marquee>
  <div class="center">
    <p>Birch has adpated to the tundra over time. Over time birches branches have<br/>
    become more flexible the allow snow to fall on them and not break the branches.<br/>
    Birch also has small sized leaves to make sure there is minimum water loss, This<br/>
    helps birch maintain its photosynthetic ability. Birch has thick bark to protect<br/>
    the inner parts of itself and to stop decaying. Birch also widly spreads out the leaves<br/>
    to obtain more oxygen. These are most of the adapataions that birch has gone through.</p>
